    Recipe testing is a lot of iterations and many new ideas and what better way to do that than with Git and GitHub
  </strong>
  <p>
    This is full-stack application made Remix to fulfill that one goal. It utilizes GitHub web flow OAuth to store recipes in the users repositories, and when it comes times to iterate on the recipes we commit to the repository the changes, or create a branch for new ideas. The actions are made easy and displayed neatly using a custom built front-end.
